        <h1>Welcome To Rayx Resto</h1>
        <p>Rayx Resto is that wildly futuristic, neon-lit food temple 
            where the whole world—and a few imaginary galaxies—collide 
            on a plate, serving dishes crafted by an international roster of 
            elite chefs who treat cuisine like high art. The ingredients 
            are hyper-fresh, the tech is borderline sorcery, and the 
            vibe is a multicultural fever dream where travelers, locals,
                aliens, and food nerds share tables like it’s a spaceport 
                café for the deliciously unhinged.</p>
